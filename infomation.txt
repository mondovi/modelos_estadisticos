In a study of cheddar cheese from the LaTrobe Valley of Victoria, Australia, samples of cheese were
   analyzed for their chemical composition and were subjected to taste tests. Overall taste scores were
   obtained by combining the scores from several tasters.

El dataframe cheddar consiste de 30 muestras de queso cheddar en las que se ha medido el sabor (Taste) y
   las concentraciones de ácido acético (Acetic), ácido sulfhídrico (H2S) y lactosa (Lactose).
